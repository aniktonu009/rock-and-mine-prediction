Suppose there is a submarin and a war going to between two countries. So submarine of a country is going to underwater to another country and the enemy country 
have planted some mines in the ocean. So submarine of a country is going whether it is crossing a mine or a rock okay.
Our job is to make a system that can predict whether the object beneath the submarine is a mine or a rock. Okay sthen let's try to understand how we are going 
to do this. First of all lets see the workflow of this project.

•	Collect the sonar data
•	Now we feed the sonar data into the ML model.
•	Our ML model can predict whether the object is made of metal or just rock.
•	The use case we are going to use a logistic regression because its work well into binary classification
